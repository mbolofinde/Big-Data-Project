Module 1: Introduction to Big Data and Hadoop
1. Introduction to Big Data
Explanation: Big Data refers to the vast volumes of data that cannot be efficiently processed using traditional database systems due to their size, complexity, and rate of growth. In this section, we'll explore how big data is changing the landscape of data analysis and decision-making.

Problems Being Solved: Traditional data processing tools are inadequate for handling the scale, diversity, and complexity of big data. This section explains the need for specialized approaches and technologies to manage, process, and extract value from big data.
Application: This concept is crucial for organizations dealing with large-scale data environments, such as social media platforms, e-commerce sites, and large-scale sensor networks in IoT applications.

2. Rise of Big Data
Explanation: This topic covers the historical evolution of big data, highlighting the technological advancements and organizational demands that have driven its prominence in recent years.
Problems Being Solved: Understanding the rise of big data helps in comprehending the scale of data generated today and the urgency for advanced analytics to leverage this data for competitive advantage.
Application: Relevant for data scientists, business analysts, and IT professionals who work with data-intensive applications across various sectors including healthcare, finance, and retail.

3. Big Data Defined
Explanation: We'll define big data through the 5 Vs: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, and Value, which collectively characterize the challenges and opportunities of big data.
Problems Being Solved: Provides a framework for understanding the multifaceted aspects of big data and its implications on data handling and processing technologies.
Application: Essential for anyone involved in data management, data engineering, and data analysis, facilitating a structured approach to tackling big data projects.
4. Big Data vs Data Warehouse
Explanation: This segment contrasts big data with traditional data warehouses, focusing on the differences in data types, processing methodologies, scalability, and performance.
Problems Being Solved: Clarifies misconceptions and sets expectations for the capabilities and limitations of big data technologies versus traditional data warehousing solutions.
Application: Useful for database administrators, data architects, and decision-makers planning data strategy and infrastructure.
5. Introduction to Hadoop
Explanation: An introduction to Hadoop as a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models.
Problems Being Solved: Hadoop addresses issues of scaling up for big data processing and provides fault tolerance and high availability, which are not easily achievable with traditional systems.
Application: Critical for data engineers and developers in environments where large-scale data processing and cost-effective storage solutions are necessary.
6. Hadoop Ecosystem Components: HDFS, Yarn, and MapReduce
Explanation:
HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System): Designed to store very large data sets reliably and to stream those data sets at high bandwidth to user applications.
Yarn (Yet Another Resource Negotiator): Manages and monitors cluster resources, facilitating job scheduling.
MapReduce: A programming model for processing large data sets with a distributed algorithm on a Hadoop cluster.
Problems Being Solved: Each component is designed to solve specific challenges in big data handlingâ€”HDFS for storage, Yarn for resource management, and MapReduce for processing.
Application: Integral for developers building applications that require scalable, efficient, and reliable data processing capabilities across large clusters.
